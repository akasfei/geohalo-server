1. base socket packet structure.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    | 2 byte #packet_size | 1 byte #event_type | * byte #packet_data |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    ps: It's it too large for a packet to use 4 byte integer as header.
        Is there any condition that we need to seed 4 bilion byte data?
    
2. event_type
    
    EVENT_ONLINE         # client connect to server. user online.
    
    EVENT_OFFLINE        # client disconnect. user offline.

    EVENT_MESSAGE_SEND   # message send from client to server.
    
    EVENT_HEART_PACKET   # make connection alive.
                         
    EVENT_RECIEVED       # client (or server) send signal packet to 
                         # server (or client) that packet is recieved.
                         
    EVENT_LOST           # client (or server) send signal packet to 
                         # server (or client) that packet is lost,
                         # sever (or client) should resend data packet.
            
    EVENT_MESSAGE_PUSH   # server push message packet to client.
    
3. message_send_packet_data structure
    
    {
        from_id: from_id,
        to_id: to_id,
        send_time: send_time,
        message: message
    }
    
4. heart_packet_data structure
    
    None.
    
5. recieved_packet_data structure
    
    None.
    
6. lost_packet_data structure
    
    None.
